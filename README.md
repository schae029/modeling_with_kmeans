# modeling_with_kmeans

Using k-means to improve upon supervised learning models.

As of May 25th 2021 this is still a work in progress.  Part 1 and Part 2 are completed.  Part 3 is uploaded, but could use some further editing.  Part 4, using the wine data, is nearly done, but may need to be split into two separate parts.
